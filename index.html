        <h3>HI, welcome to my Portfolio Website!</h3>
        <h1>I'm <span>Andrew Chan</span></h1>
        <p>
            I have just graduated in December 2022 from my Master Study in Newcastle University, studying Computer Science. I majored in English Studies in Hong Kong before, while after I graduated from my Bachelor Degree, I realised my interest in Technology and decided to take a step out of my comfort zone by choosing a completely different subject to study for my Master Degree, and eventually going to Newcastle University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to be an intern in Hong Kong Design Centre while I was still undergoing my Bachelor studies, and my major duties during that time were to maintain the company's website, the company's social media, and also helping colleagues on data researching and organising. The job was a bit challenging for me at that time as most of the things I had to do were new to me, however I enjoyed the process as I see myself as a person that loves challenges, and also the self-learning process when facing challenges. During the internship period, I got to learn new skills such as managing company's email, managing the company's website which required a bit of coding knowledge, and most important, the skills to communicate in a workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my attitude towards challenges and how much I enjoyed self-learning makes it easier for me to blend into a new environment quicker and smoother, for example I learned a bit of coding in order to manage my daily duties during my internship, also enhanced my skills in collecting and organising data to help in a government project during the internship period. What is more, being initiative in terms of self-learning helped me a lot in my master study. As computer science is a completely new subject to me, I self-learned a bit of computer languaging knowledge before I went to Newcastle University, which helped me understand the course easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I was graduated from my master study, I am looking for graduate jobs, ideally information technology related, such that I could gain more experience in this field, and continue to improve my personal skills at the same time.
